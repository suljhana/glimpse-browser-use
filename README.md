üåê Browser-use is the easiest way to connect your AI agents with the browser.

üí° See what others are building and share your projects in our [Discord](https://link.browser-use.com/discord)! Want Swag? Check out our [Merch store](https://browsermerch.com).

üå§Ô∏è Skip the setup - try our <b>hosted version</b> for instant browser automation! <b>[Try the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏é](https://cloud.browser-use.com)</b>.

# Quick start

With pip (Python>=3.11):

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

For memory functionality (requires Python<3.13 due to PyTorch compatibility):  

```bash
pip install "browser-use[memory]"
```

Install the browser:
```bash
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
GROK_API_KEY=
NOVITA_API_KEY=
```

For other settings, models, and more, check out the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).

### Test with UI

You can test browser-use using its [Web UI](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui) or [Desktop App](https://github.com/browser-use/desktop).

### Test with an interactive CLI

You can also use our `browser-use` interactive CLI (similar to `claude` code):

```bash
pip install browser-use[cli]
browser-use
```

# Vision

Tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.

## Roadmap

### Agent

- [ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
- [ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
- [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

- [ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
- [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

- [ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
- [ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience

- [ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
- [ ] Improve docs
- [ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization

- [ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.


## Contributing

We love contributions! Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature requests. To contribute to the docs, check out the `/docs` folder.

## Local Setup

To learn more about the library, check out the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).


`main` is the primary development branch with frequent changes. For production use, install a stable [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases) instead.

# Human-Like Browser Interaction

This fork of [browser-use](https://github.com/cohere-ai/browser-use) adds realistic human-like mouse movements and typing behaviors to create more natural browser interactions.

## Features

- **Realistic Mouse Movements**: The mouse cursor now follows a human-like path with natural acceleration and deceleration when interacting with elements.
- **Varied Mouse Movement Patterns**: Choose between linear, bezier curve, or human-like movement patterns.
- **Natural Typing Behavior**: Characters are typed with variable delays between keystrokes.
- **Configurable Behavior**: Adjust speed, variation, and movement patterns to match specific use cases.

## Usage

To enable human-like interactions, create a `BrowserProfile` with the appropriate settings:

```python
from browser_use.browser.profile import BrowserProfile

# Create a profile with human-like behaviors
human_profile = BrowserProfile(
    use_human_like_mouse=True,                # Enable human-like mouse movements
    mouse_movement_pattern="human",           # Use the most realistic pattern
    min_mouse_movement_time=0.3,              # Minimum time to complete a movement
    max_mouse_movement_time=1.0,              # Maximum time to complete a movement
    mouse_speed_variation=0.4,                # Amount of speed variation
    headless=False                            # Set to False to see the movements
)

# Use this profile with your agent
agent = Agent(
    task, 
    model, 
    controller=controller, 
    use_vision=True,
    browser_profile=human_profile
)
```

## Movement Patterns

The following mouse movement patterns are available:

- **linear**: Simple straight line movement from point A to point B.
- **bezier**: Curved movement using quadratic bezier curves, more natural than linear.
- **human**: The most realistic pattern with slight variations, acceleration/deceleration, and occasional small errors.

## Example

Check out the example in `examples/use-cases/check_appointment_human.py` which demonstrates how to use this functionality.

## Why Add Human-Like Interactions?

1. **Avoiding Bot Detection**: Many websites use behavioral analysis to detect bots. Human-like interactions can help avoid detection.
2. **Testing User Experience**: More accurately simulate real user behavior for testing websites and applications.
3. **Training AI Agents**: Provide more realistic interactions when training AI agents to use web interfaces.

## Implementation Details

The human-like behavior is implemented through:

1. `MouseMovementService`: Generates and executes realistic mouse movements.
2. Modified interaction methods in `BrowserSession`: Uses the mouse service before clicks and inputs.
3. Configuration options in `BrowserProfile`: Controls the behavior of the movements.

## Credits

This project is a fork of [browser-use](https://github.com/cohere-ai/browser-use) with enhancements for human-like interactions.
